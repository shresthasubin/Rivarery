        <p>While technology has brought significant advancements to the watch industry, it has also introduced several challenges and drawbacks. Below are some of the negative impacts:</p>

        <h3>Decline in Demand for Traditional Watches</h3>
        <p>With the rise of smartwatches, the demand for traditional mechanical watches has decreased. Consumers are increasingly opting for smartwatches that offer features like fitness tracking, notifications, and GPS functionality.</p>

        <h3>Market Saturation</h3>
        <p>Mass production enabled by technology has led to market saturation, where lower-quality watches flood the market. This affects the perception of premium watch brands and creates tough competition.</p>

        <h3>Loss of Craftsmanship</h3>
        <p>As automation takes over, there is a risk of losing traditional watchmaking skills and craftsmanship, which are integral to the heritage and uniqueness of the watch industry.</p>
